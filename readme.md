# TMD-Backend-Gin

This is a very basic backend service of a Todolist with user system.

I am using this project to learn Golang and Gin Gonic Framework.

## Quick start

- Clone this repo.

```bash
git clone
```

- Download dependencies using `Go Module`

```bash
go mod download
```

- Add environment variables in `.env` file

```
# .env

DB_HOST=
DB_PASS=
DB_USER=
DB_NAME=
```

- If the [air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air)  has not installed, install it on computer first.

- Happy coding

```bash
air
```
